# Algerian Forest Fires Detection Flask App

This Flask application leverages the Algerian Forest Fires dataset to predict and visualize forest fire occurrences in Algeria. The dataset spans from June 2012 to September 2012, covering two significant regions: the Bejaia region in the northeast and the Sidi Bel-abbes region in the northwest of Algeria. With 244 instances and detailed attributes related to fire detection, our application aims to provide insights and predictive analytics on forest fire occurrences.

## Dataset Overview

The Algerian Forest Fires dataset comprises 244 instances, with data from two distinct regions of Algeria. It includes a variety of attributes that are crucial for understanding and predicting forest fires:

- **Date:** Day, month, and year (DD/MM/YYYY) ranging from June to September 2012.
- **Temperature (Temp):** Noon temperature in Celsius (22 to 42Â°C).
- **Relative Humidity (RH):** Percentage of relative humidity (21 to 90%).
- **Wind Speed (Ws):** In km/h (6 to 29 km/h).
- **Rain:** Total day rainfall in mm (0 to 16.8 mm).
- **Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC):** Index from the FWI system (28.6 to 92.5).
- **Duff Moisture Code (DMC):** Index from the FWI system (1.1 to 65.9).
- **Drought Code (DC):** Index from the FWI system (7 to 220.4).
- **Initial Spread Index (ISI):** Index from the FWI system (0 to 18.5).
- **Buildup Index (BUI):** Index from the FWI system (1.1 to 68).
- **Fire Weather Index (FWI):** Index from the FWI system (0 to 31.1).
- **Classes:** Classified into two categories - Fire and Not Fire.

## Application Features

- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a forest fire based on the input data.
- **Data Visualization:** Offers interactive charts and graphs to visualize the data and the predictive results effectively.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an easy-to-navigate web interface for users to interact with the predictive model and visualizations.
